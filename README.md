# odin-recipes
Building a basic recipe website as a test of my current skills.

Basically this is my first project on The Odin Project where my goal is to refresh & build on my web development skills since my polytechnic days. 

This website is a recipe website that well serve as an application of what I have learnt so far:
- Linux Terminal Commands
- Git & Github Command Line
- HTML Basics
