        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Miso is the ultimate reference point for the flavor sensation known as umami. The paste and the soup have a deep savory flavor, with toasty, funky, salty-sweet richness. This umami flavor forms the base of a lot of everyday Japanese cooking.</p>
        
        <p>It is thought that miso originated as a fermented food in ancient China. It is most likely that it was introduced to Japan via mainland China and the Korean Peninsula in the Asuka period during the 7th Century. The characters for "miso" first appeared in literature during the Heian period.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>1 (4 inch) piece dashi kombu (dried kelp)</li>
            <li>½ cup bonito flakes</li>
            <li>½ (12 ounce) package tofu, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried wakame</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons miso paste</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat water in a large pot over low heat. Add kombu and cook until the mixture just begins to simmer. Stir in bonito flakes until combined. Remove pot from the heat and let dashi sit, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Strain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 3 1/2 cups dashi in a pot over medium heat. Add tofu and wakame; stir to combine. Remove 1 cup warmed dashi to a small bowl and whisk in miso paste.
