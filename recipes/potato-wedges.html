            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Potato wedges are irregular wedge-shaped slices of potato, often large and unpeeled, that are either baked or fried. They are sold at diners and fast food restaurants. In Australia, potato wedges are a common bar food, that are almost always served with some kind of sauce.</p>
            
            <p>The technique was invented by L.A.M. Phelan in the early 1950s and is marketed by the Broaster Company of Beloit, Wisconsin, which Phelan founded. Broasting equipment and ingredients are marketed only to food service and institutional customers, including supermarkets and fast food restaurants</p>
